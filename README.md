# Using Third Party Libraries to make API Calls

Technologies Used:
- [React](https://react.dev)
- [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app)

## Why use SWR?
- SWR is a strategy to first return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate), and finally come with the up-to-date data.
- SWR helps us fetch data from APIs using a custom hook provided by the library.
